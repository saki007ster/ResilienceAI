## 🚀 How to Test the Enhanced System

- Choose a recommended model (marked with ⭐)
- Click "Initialize" and wait for download/loading

### 3. **Experience Real AI**
Try these test prompts to see the difference:

**Example 1:**
```
"I'm feeling overwhelmed with work stress and don't know how to cope."
```

**Example 2:**
```
"I've been having trouble sleeping lately. Can you help me with some techniques?"
```

**Example 3:**
```
"I want to build better habits but keep failing. What should I do?"
```

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### **Before (Mock System)**
```
User: "I'm feeling anxious"
AI: "I understand you're saying: 'I'm feeling anxious'. As your AI wellness coach, I'm here to support you through this. Let me help you explore some healthy coping strategies..."
```

### **After (Real LLM)**
```
User: "I'm feeling anxious"
AI: "I can sense that anxiety is really weighing on you right now, and I want you to know that what you're experiencing is completely valid. Anxiety can feel overwhelming, but there are effective ways we can work through this together.

Can you help me understand what's been triggering these anxious feelings lately? Sometimes it helps to identify specific situations or thoughts that contribute to the anxiety.

In the meantime, let's try a quick grounding technique: Take a slow breath in for 4 counts, hold for 4, then exhale for 6 counts. This can help activate your body's relaxation response."
```
