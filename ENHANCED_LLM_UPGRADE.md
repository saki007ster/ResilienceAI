# Enhanced LLM Upgrade Guide for ResilienceAI

## Overview

This guide shows how to upgrade ResilienceAI from the current mock AI responses to real, powerful LLM capabilities using WebLLM for completely client-side inference.

## Current vs Enhanced Implementation

### Current Issues (Mock System)
- ❌ Generic template responses that don't understand context

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Update Chat Window Component

Replace the current `AiCoachService` with `AiCoachEnhancedService` in your chat window:

```typescript
// src/app/components/chat-window/chat-window.ts

import { AiCoachEnhancedService, ModelOption } from '../../services/ai-coach-enhanced.service';
import { ModelSelector } from '../model-selector/model-selector';

export class ChatWindow implements OnInit, OnDestroy {
  // Replace the old service
  constructor(
    private aiCoachService: AiCoachEnhancedService, // Changed from AiCoachService
    private modelDownloadService: ModelDownloadService,
    public headTts: HeadTts
  ) {}

  // Add model selection properties
  showModelSelector = false;
  availableModels: ModelOption[] = [];

  ngOnInit() {
    // Get available models
    this.availableModels = this.aiCoachService.availableModels;
    
    // Show model selector if no model is initialized
    this.aiStateSubscription = this.aiCoachService.state$.subscribe(
      state => {
        this.aiState = state;
        this.showModelSelector = !state.isInitialized;
        this.updateMessages();
      }
    );
  }

  // Add model selection handlers
  onModelSelected(modelId: string): void {
    this.aiCoachService.initializeModel(modelId);
  }

  onModelSwitched(modelId: string): void {
    this.aiCoachService.switchModel(modelId);
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Update Chat Window Template

Add the model selector to your chat window template:

```html
<!-- src/app/components/chat-window/chat-window.html -->

<div class="chat-window-container">
  <!-- Model Selector (shown when no model is loaded) -->
  <div *ngIf="showModelSelector" class="model-selector-section">
    <app-model-selector
      [availableModels]="availableModels"
      [currentModel]="aiState.currentModel"
      [isLoading]="aiState.isLoading"
      [isInitialized]="aiState.isInitialized"
      (modelSelected)="onModelSelected($event)"
      (initializeTriggered)="onModelSelected(availableModels[0]?.id)">
    </app-model-selector>
  </div>

  <!-- Existing chat interface (shown when model is ready) -->
  <div *ngIf="!showModelSelector" class="chat-interface">
    <!-- Your existing chat interface code -->
  </div>
</div>
```

### Step 3: Update Component Imports

Add the new components to your imports:

```typescript
// src/app/components/chat-window/chat-window.ts
import { ModelSelector } from '../model-selector/model-selector';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-chat-window',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [CommonModule, FormsModule, ModelDownload, Avatar, ModelSelector], // Add ModelSelector
  templateUrl: './chat-window.html',
  styleUrl: './chat-window.scss'
})
```

### Step 4: Enhanced Constitutional Prompting

The new system includes advanced prompting specifically designed for mental health:

```typescript
// Automatically included in AiCoachEnhancedService
// Features:
// - Multiple therapeutic approaches (CBT, ACT, mindfulness)
// - Trauma-informed care principles
// - Cultural sensitivity
// - Evidence-based interventions
// - Safety guidelines with professional referrals
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Implementation
```typescript
// Initialize with default model
await this.aiCoachService.initializeModel();

// Generate response
const response = await this.aiCoachService.generateResponse("I'm feeling anxious about work");
```

### Advanced Model Selection
```typescript
// Switch to therapy-focused model
await this.aiCoachService.switchModel('Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct-q4f16_1-MLC');

// Get model information
const modelInfo = this.aiCoachService.getModelInfo();
console.log(`Using: ${modelInfo?.name} (${modelInfo?.size})`);
```

### Conversation Management
```typescript
// Get conversation history
const history = this.aiCoachService.getConversationHistory();

// Clear conversation
this.aiCoachService.clearConversation();
```

## Migration Benefits Summary

### Before (Mock System)
```
User: "I'm feeling depressed"
AI: "I understand you're saying: 'I'm feeling depressed'. As your AI wellness coach, I'm here to support you through this. Let me help you explore some healthy coping strategies..."
```

### After (Real LLM)
```
User: "I'm feeling depressed"
AI: "I hear that you're going through a really difficult time right now, and I want you to know that reaching out takes courage. Depression can feel overwhelming, but you don't have to face this alone.

Can you tell me a bit more about what's been happening in your life lately? Sometimes depression can be triggered by specific events, or it might feel like it came out of nowhere. Understanding your unique experience will help me better support you.

In the meantime, please know that what you're feeling is valid, and there are effective ways to work through this together."
```

## Next Steps
