## Testing Strategy

Each phase should include:
- [ ] Unit tests for new services
- [ ] Integration tests for component interactions
- [ ] PWA functionality verification
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarking

## Branch Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code, phase completions
- `phase-3-*` - Feature branches for Phase 3 development
- `phase-4-*` - Feature branches for Phase 4 development
- `hotfix-*` - Critical fixes that need immediate deployment

## Build & Deployment

```bash
# Development
ng serve

# Production build
ng build --configuration production

# Test PWA functionality
npx http-server dist/resilience-ai -p 8080

# Test service worker
# Open Chrome DevTools > Application > Service Workers
```

## Performance Targets

- **First Contentful Paint:** < 1.5s
- **Largest Contentful Paint:** < 2.5s  
- **Time to Interactive:** < 3.5s
- **Model Download:** Background, non-blocking
- **Chat Response Time:** < 2s for AI generation
